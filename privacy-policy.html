    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 6, 2026</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Scroll Pause doesn't collect, store, or transmit any of your data. Everything stays on your device. We don't track you. We don't sell your data. We don't even know you're using the app.
    </div>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        Scroll Pause does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. All data related to your screen time usage, budgets, and settings is stored locally on your device using your device's storage.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        The following data is stored locally on your device:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your daily screen time budget preference</li>
        <li>Time used today</li>
        <li>Lock/unlock status</li>
        <li>Session timestamps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data never leaves your device. It is not backed up to our servers because we don't have servers. If you delete the app, all data is permanently deleted.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Scroll Pause does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services. We don't integrate with Facebook, Google Analytics, or any other tracking platforms.
    </p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>
        The app requests permission to send local notifications to alert you when your screen time budget is used up. These notifications are generated locally on your device and do not involve any external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        Scroll Pause requests the following permissions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To alert you when time is up</li>
        <li><strong>Background processing:</strong> To keep the timer running when the app is closed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        No other permissions are requested or required.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Scroll Pause does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since we don't collect any data at all, there is no risk of collecting children's data.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        To delete all your data, simply delete the app from your device. Since all data is stored locally, deleting the app permanently removes all associated data.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
